#Learning Variables. Just like any other language.
number = 1
Number = 2.3 #Variable names are case sensitive.
print (type(number)) #Dynamically assigns data type- dynamically typed language
print (type(Number))
number = "Hello" # Changed the type. Dynamically typed
NuMber = 4
print (type(number))
print (NuMber+Number) # Evaluation of expression within a function itself
#2A #-- not a good variable name
